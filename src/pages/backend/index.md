# Backend Introduction

The backend of this task management system is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, offering a scalable and performant architecture. The database layer is handled using **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**, providing flexible schema definitions and data validation. **GraphQL** is integrated to enable efficient querying and manipulation of data, improving the overall API performance.

Real-time communication is supported through **Socket.io**, facilitating live updates and collaboration features, such as task notifications and status changes. To ensure the security and integrity of the system, **jsonwebtoken** is used for authentication, while **express-rate-limit** helps prevent abuse by limiting repeated requests.

The backend also includes:

- **Multer** for file uploads,
- **express-validator** for robust input validation,
- **mongoose-paginate** for handling large datasets efficiently, and
- **Sentry** for error monitoring and logging.

API documentation is generated and maintained using **Swagger** (via `swagger-jsdoc` or `swagger-ui-express`), while **Jest** is utilized for unit testing, ensuring the stability and reliability of the backend. This combination of technologies ensures a secure, scalable, and maintainable backend system, capable of supporting large-scale task management operations.
