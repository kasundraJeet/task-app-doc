# Task Management System

## Introduction

This project is a large-scale, full-stack task management system designed to streamline task organization, tracking, and collaboration. The system is built with a robust backend powered by **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, offering high performance, scalability, and security. The backend leverages **GraphQL** for efficient data querying and includes testing via **Jest** to ensure reliability.

To enhance documentation and API interaction, the project integrates **Swagger** (via `swagger-jsdoc` or `swagger-ui-express`), while **Sentry** is employed for error monitoring. Security measures include **jsonwebtoken** for authentication and **express-rate-limit** for request throttling. Pagination is implemented using **mongoose-paginate**, file uploads are handled by **Multer**, and form validation is managed with **express-validator**.

On the frontend, the system uses **Svelte.js**, ensuring a modern, reactive, and lightweight user experience, making it ideal for managing tasks efficiently in large-scale environments.

The project emphasizes performance, security, and scalability, aiming to provide an optimized and user-friendly task management solution for both individual and team use.
