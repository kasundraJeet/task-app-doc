During sign-up, users are required to provide:

1. First Name

## 4. Forgot Password

If a user forgets their password:

1. They can request a password reset by entering their registered email.
2. An OTP (One-Time Password) will be sent to their email for verification.
3. After OTP verification, the user is given the option to create a new password.
4. Once the new password is set, they can continue to log in and get started.
